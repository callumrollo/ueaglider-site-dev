# Website development log

A rough log mostly for my own benefit. May include with the website documentation.

## Pre build

### 2021-01-03

Created a flask project

Experimenting with maps. Created a basic OSM map from the leaflet tutorial. 

Created a GEBCO map using info from leaflet wms tutorial https://leafletjs.com/examples/wms/wms.html
Another GEBCO with brighter colours and no hill shade is available by replacing layer `GEBCO_2019_Grid` with `GEBCO_2019_Grid_2` but it is less aesthetically pleasing.

Put both the GEBCO maps on the leaflet map as selectable layers
